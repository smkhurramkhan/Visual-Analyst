# Visual-Analyst
This is a camera app that continuously detects the objects (bounding boxes and classes) in the frames seen by your device's back camera, using a quantized MobileNet SSD model trained on the COCO dataset. These instructions walk you through building and running the demo on an Android device.  The model files are downloaded via Gradle scripts when you build and run. You don't need to do any steps to download TFLite models into the project explicitly.  Application can run either on device or emulator.
